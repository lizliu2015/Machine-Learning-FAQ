What is Bias?
Bias is the difference between the average prediction and the correct value. It is also known as Bias Error or Error due to Bias.
Low Bias models: k-Nearest Neighbors (k=1), Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines.
High Bias models: Linear Regression and Logistic Regression.

What is Variance?
Variance is the amount that the prediction will change if different training data sets were used. It measures how scattered (inconsistent) are the predicted values from the correct value due to different training data sets.
It is also known as Variance Error or Error due to Variance.
Low Variance models: Linear Regression and Logistic Regression.
High Variance models: k-Nearest Neighbors (k=1), Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines.
